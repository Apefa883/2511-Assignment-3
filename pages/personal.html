                        Just looking at someone's qualifications is a poor way to get to know someone. So, this page

                        Generally, you don't learn much about a person from a website. That doesn't mean it isn't worth trying. 
                        This page is a really basic summary of who I am.

                                That list to the right (or below if you're on mobile) will offer a basic idea of my hobbies. 
                                During the summer, I often go SCUBA Diving. At the moment, I am working on my drysuit qualifications
                                to go diving in colder waters and eventually even in winter! Although I doubt I'll make a career
                                out of SCUBA or saturation diving, it's still a great way to spend summer days and gain practical
                                skill making precise plans and taking care of life-saving gear.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When I'm not diving, I'll often spend time cycling across the city or jogging for exercise. When jogging,
                                I'll drag my dog along when he's up for it. 
                                Although I haven't done much nature photography recently, I'm still looking forward to the summer to get
                                back into it. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Modpack Dev is another good winter hobby, as it typically doesn't involve much exposure to the elements.
                                What it does involve, however, is coding and organizational skills. Making planets and machines work
                                correctly in games involves a substantial amount of coding knowledge and the ability to organize
                                a staggering amount of resource folders correctly.
